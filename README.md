# DHCPServer

Open source managed ipv4 DHCP server implementation, written in C#. With extensive support for DHCP options it is ideally suited for configuring and netbooting local systems such as PLCs and blade racks. The permissive MIT license enables free commercial use and distribution.

Check out the [wiki](../../wiki) for more details on how to embed the DHCP server in your application.
